# Q&A User Service

This project is a first in a series of micro-services to provide back-end support
of a home-made stackoverflow project, initially designed and implemented by [denisftw](https://github.com/denisftw).

It is intended to communicate with sibling microservices as well as with clients in order 
to both replicate and replace [the existing monolith implementation](https://github.com/denisftw/event-sourcing-scala).
